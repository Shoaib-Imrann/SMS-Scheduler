## ðŸ§¾ Why International SMS Route?

In India, bulk SMS needs **DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) approval**, which involves:
- Organization registration
- Header and template approval
- Manual approval delays

To simplify the process, **an international SMS route** is used, which bypasses DLT requirements for testing purposes.

## ðŸ”’ Notes

This project is for demo and testing purposes.<br>
For production in India, DLT compliance and template approval will be required.<br> 
International SMS may have additional cost implications.
